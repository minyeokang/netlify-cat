### Cat animation by Lottie

***

This is a pretty simple animation. 

Click the paw to start creating cats where you click, and watch them start walking.

If you want a different animation, follow the steps below:


1. Get (free) resources from <https://lottiefiles.com/featured>
2. Change the URL of the path variables in the script.js file.
3. Make sure to log out the childNode of the new animation. 

The Node data of changeColor function has to be modified depending on the SVG data.

By the way....

<b>ChatGPT</b> was used to build this project. 
it was very helpful but it also had a lot of error and outdated information. 

but it was really helpful for refactoring and studying javascript itself. 

definitely recommend using it especially if you are learning something new!
